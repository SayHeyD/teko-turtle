    # Basically, instead of calculating a lot of unnecessary divisions in
    # hopes of finding a magic divider that mathematically and logically
    # cannot exist, we just calculate the absolute minimum of options
    # required to safely determine if the given number is a prime.
    #
    # 1. If the number is even, it is divisible by 2 â†’ not a prime number, return False
    # 2. Compute the integer square root; no divisor greater than sqrt(number) needs checking
    #     * A number cannot have two or more factors both greater than its square root because
    #       their product would exceed the original number
    # 3. Try only odd divisors from 3 up to that limit. If it divides evenly -> not a prime number, return False
    #    * All even numbers are excluded in step 1
    # 4. If no divisor was found in the previous steps -> is a prime number, return True
